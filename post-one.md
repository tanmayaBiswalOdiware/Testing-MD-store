## First Post

This will be a post about something random.
In the original chapter Kubo states, the older brother can mimmick the appearance and the powers of the opponent while the younger brother, can only copy the memories, mind and appearance. Quite different power I msut say.
Despite him just copying the mind and memories, he was still able to withstand the ample power of Zaraki and Yamaji. Incredible, I must say.

Just watched a video on Bleach, so that's what I wrote about in the above paragraph. Its a quite a job to be writing all this, you know? Definitely want to auto generate some...shiz and be done but I guess its not gonna be
that easy lol. Alright, I think I will end this here and start writing out the next one.
