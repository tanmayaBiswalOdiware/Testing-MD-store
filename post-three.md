## Advent of Me

_What do I mean by **Advent of Me**?_ I am not sure either. I jsut wrote it for the sake of writing some nonsense. Gibbering, if you may call it that.

I didnt really have anything in mind when I wrote the title. It just is what it is. Oh hey, just ate an orange and an apple. Very tasty.

Oranges have vitamin C, right? Why are almost all fruits so tasty anyway? Can humans just eat fruits and be content all their life? Is it necessary they eat cooked food? I dont know.

I have no answers for you, but I do wonder how feasible would it be for someone to never eat anything else besides just fruits. Although, it will definitely be a costly way to live 
considering the amount of money these fruits cost. Some more than others, though banana has always been the best friend and the cheapest any man can ever afford. As someone was saying on the 
internet, Bananas are like cheatcode. They are like **SO CHEAP** even though they provide the same level of nutrition as other fruits, its insane!

Anyway, that's it for this one.
