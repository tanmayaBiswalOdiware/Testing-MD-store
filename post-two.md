## Second Post

The mind of human can think of multiple weird things. Some of those are listed below:

1) The thoughts of how the accident even happened?
2) What I am going to be writing next?
3) I want to each some mixture or something tastefully spicy. Masala.
4) Just talked about how things have changed over the years.
5) Why did dad stop washing his own clothes after Sector-14?

Yep, this was an ordered list.

Here is some unordered list:

- One of my friend got married.
- Tomorrow couple of my friends are coming to visit me.
- I want to write a couple of markdown files to download them off later using an API.
- Can cushions harden because of compressing of the wools inside?
- Somebody sent me a text. Wonder what or who it will be.
